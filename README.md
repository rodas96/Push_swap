The learning objectives of this project are rigor, use of C, and use of basic algorithms. Especially focusing on their complexity.

This project will make me sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an
optimized data sorting.
